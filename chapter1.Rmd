## Dissecting the Layers of Profitability: Gross and Net Margins Unveiled {-}
The gross profit margin reveals the percentage of revenue a company keeps as profit after paying for business expenses like labor and materials. Essentially, it tells us how much of every dollar earned  remains after costs. This metric helps companies understand their efficiency and determine if they need to reduce costs to increase profits.

In fiscal 2016, GameStop's gross profit margin peaked at 34.96%. By 2021, it had dropped to its lowest at 22.42%. Although there has been a general decline since fiscal 2016, there were minor increases: from 27.86% in fiscal 2018 to 29.62% in fiscal 2019, and from 22.42% in fiscal 2021 to 23.15% in fiscal 2022. Given these trends, GameStop might consider reducing labor expenses or sourcing more affordable materials. 

Like the gross profit margin, the net profit margin shows how much money a company earns. But, while the gross profit margin only considers direct production costs (costs only related to production), the net profit margin also includes non-operating expenses, which are not directly tied to producing goods (taxes, interests, etc). This metric helps determine if a company's sales are sufficient to cover **all** its expenses, not just production costs.

The fiscal year 2018 marked GameStop's peak net profit margin at 8.123%. This was closely followed by 7.283% in fiscal 2019. The margins for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2020 were relatively consistent, averaging around the 4.2% mark. However, the fiscal year 2017 stood out with a notably low net profit margin of just **0.406%**. This deviation suggests a deeper investigation into the underlying factors contributing to the significant margin change in that year.

## Peeling Back the Layers: Unraveling the Drivers of Margin Shifts {-}

Beginning our investigation, we analyze the expenses subtracted from the gross profit to derive the firm's net income. Then, a closer examination of the company's commentary on its financial performance.

From fiscal 2015 to 2017, we observe a growth in gross profit by approximately 4%, moving from $2.918 billion in 2015 to a peak of $3.040 billion in fiscal 2017. Between the fiscal years 2016 and 2017, there is a decrease in other costs (costs other than asset impairments), dropping from 98.88% to 87.15%. However, during this same period, there is a significant increase in goodwill and asset impairments, which rose from 1.12% to 12.85%. This trend intensified by the end of fiscal 2018, with goodwill and asset impairments escalating to $1.015 billion or **44.01% of the gross profit**. This surge in impairments could be a driving factor behind GameStop's strategic decision to reduce other costs to 55.99% in 2018, **down from 87.15% the previous fiscal year**, aiming to optimize profitability due to rising impairment costs. 

In their financial statement for the fiscal year 2017, GameStop revealed a devaluation in their dealer agreements with both Spring Mobile and Simply Mac. In short, a dealer agreement is a contractual arrangement, allowing GameStop to sell products from these manufacturers. Breaking down the asset impairment charges, $328.8 million was linked to Spring Mobile agreements, while $11 million was associated with Simply Mac agreements. This devaluation stemmed from revised profitability projections, which were less optimistic than earlier estimates. This miscalculation in asset profitability likely contributed to the notable dip in net income for fiscal 2017, and thus influenced GameStop's decision to implement cost-cutting measures in fiscal 2018.

To support our hypothesis, we turn our attention to GameStop's operating margin. This indicator provides a deeper understanding of a firm's earnings from its core business operations, encompassing areas like production, marketing, and other related functions. By comparing operating margin to net profit margin, we can measure the influence of non-core operations on the net income, such as the effects of losses from asset sales.

Like the previous evaluation of GameStop's asset effects on its gross profit and subsequent net income for fiscal years 2017 to 2018, we observe an increase in net profit margin from **0.406% to 8.123%** and in the operating margin from 5.140% to 8.470%. This trend aligns with the earlier hypothesis that GameStop undertook cost cutting measures to increase its profitability in fiscal 2018. But, the sharp rise in net profit margin by **7.717%** relative to the 3.33% increase in operating margin suggests that the cut expenses were predominantly non-operational rather than core operational costs. 

Assuming that the dealer agreements were the primary reason behind the significant dip in GameStop's net income in fiscal 2017, the subsequent spike in net profit margin for fiscal 2018 can likely be attributed to GameStop's move to sell its entire equity in Spring mobile on January 16, 2019. From this transaction, GameStop gained a total of $729.9 million or, after tax, $65.4 million. 

## Analysis Overview {-}
In our analysis so far, we've delved into GameStop's financial reports, focusing on their profitability and operational efficiency during the fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Notably, in response to a marked decline in net income in fiscal 2017, largely attributed to the dealer agreement losses, GameStop enhanced its profitability in fiscal 2018 by cutting non-core expenses, mitigating the effects of increasing losses from asset impairments.

While this provides valuable insights, a more comprehensive perspective can be gained by benchmarking GameStop's financial metrics against its competitors in the retail sector. The next chapter undertakes this comparative analysis to offer a more nuanced view of GameStop's financial health.
