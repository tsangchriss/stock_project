(note that GME has yet to release Q3 and Q4 data in 2023)

In fiscal 2020, all four quarters saw the lowest revenue compared to other years, with the second quarter (Q2) having the absolute lowest at $942 million. In contrast, the highest revenue was observed in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2021, totaling to $2,253.9 billion. Between 2020 and 2021, each quarter experienced a significant revenue increase compared to other years, with growth rates of 25.05%, 25.63%, 29.05%, and 6.21% for Q1 through Q4, respectively. In comparison, from 2021 to 2022, the revenue changes for each quarter were more modest: 8% in Q1, 4% in Q2, 9% in Q3, and 1% in Q4.

**Revenue** serves as a vital measure of a company's overall well-bring, influencing both investment decisions and the company's operational strategies. Judging solely by its revenue performance, GME had an excellent financial run in 2020 and 2021. The year 2021 was particularly strong, with revenue growth exceeding 25% in three out of its four quarters compared to the same quarters in the prior year.

In all quarters except Q4, GME reported a net loss with the most significant loss occurring in Q1 of fiscal 2020 at $165.7 million. When we look at the net income ratios between the quarters from 2020 to 2021, we see varying numbers: 0.4031 for Q1, 0.5535 for Q2, 5.6064 for Q3, and -1.8323 for Q4. A negative ratio points to a flip in the sign of net income. The highest profit was recording in Q4 of 2020, totaling $80.5 million.

**Net income** is another crucial financial indicator that sheds light on a company's profitability. A positive net income usually indicates good financial health, making the firm more appealing to potential investors and paving the way for growth. Generally, GME has seen net losses quarter over quarter. Its expenses have mostly been larger than its revenue. Does that mean GME has been financially struggling since 2020? Not necessarily. The company might still have positive cash flow, vital for daily operations and future planning. But, the recurring net losses do raise questions about its financial stability, suggesting a deeper investigation into its cash flows over the years.

A short analysis of GameStop shows noticeable differences in both revenue and net income. The fluctuations in these financial indicators, **particularly in the fiscal year 2021**, suggests a more in depth review of the company's financial situation.
