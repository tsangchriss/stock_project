After 2020, the company’s financial position has been under intense scrutiny, particularly following the dramatic stock price increase in January 2021. The primary objective of this analysis is to cut through the speculative chatter and provide an objective evaluation of GameStop’s financials, sourced from SEC filings. This is not an investment recommendation but an attempt to present a clear financial picture of the firm. Utilizing the SEC’s EDGAR database and key financial indicators, we delve into GameStop and its competitors’ annual 10K reports for an unbiased comparison. While the analysis remain objective, certain inferences regarding specific financial metrics are made to provide context. Having said that, the questions this project attempts to answer are: 1) How does GameStop’s profitability show in its financials? 2) How does GameStop adapt to particular financial shifts? 3) In financial terms, how does GameStop stack up against its competitors? Process In pursuing a concise and insightful analysis, I first identified key financial metrics related to a company’s profitability, efficiency, and risk. Data from the annual reports was sourced from the SEC’s EDGAR platform and then transferred to Excel spreadsheets. After ensuring data accuracy, I imported this information to pgAdmin4, executed PostgreSQL queries for relevant data extraction, and visualized the findings in Tableau. These visuals were then incorporated into an R markdown, using the Bookdown package in Rstudio. Why This Project? The last time I visited a GameStop was probably during my middle school years with my family. Since then, we’ve shifted to mostly online shopping for its convenience and cost savings. So, when I recently came across a GameStop store in a San Francisco mall, I was curious about the company’s current state. My research into the company revealed multiple interesting events, from leadership changes to a popular subreddit called “WallStreetBets” on Reddit. This cascade of information piqued my interest and became the catalyst for this project.

Essentially, it tells us how much of every dollar earned remains after costs. This metric helps companies understand their efficiency and determine if they need to reduce costs to increase profits. In fiscal 2016, GameStop’s gross profit margin peaked at 34.96%. By 2021, it had dropped to its lowest at 22.42%. Although there has been a general decline since fiscal 2016, there were minor increases: from 27.86% in fiscal 2018 to 29.62% in fiscal 2019, and from 22.42% in fiscal 2021 to 23.15% in fiscal 2022. Given these trends, GameStop might consider reducing labor expenses or sourcing more affordable materials. Like the gross profit margin, the net profit margin shows how much money a company earns. But, while the gross profit margin only considers direct production costs (costs only related to production), the net profit margin also includes non-operating expenses, which are not directly tied to producing goods (taxes, interests, etc). This metric helps determine if a company’s sales are sufficient to cover all its expenses, not just production costs. The fiscal year 2018 marked GameStop’s peak net profit margin at 8.123%. This was closely followed by 7.283% in fiscal 2019. The margins for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2020 were relatively consistent, averaging around the 4.2% mark. However, the fiscal year 2017 stood out with a notably low net profit margin of just 0.406%. This deviation suggests a deeper investigation into the underlying factors contributing to the significant margin change in that year. Peeling Back the Layers: Unraveling the Drivers of Margin Shifts Beginning our investigation, we analyze the expenses subtracted from the gross profit to derive the firm’s net income. Then, a closer examination of the company’s commentary on its financial performance. (click the “Full Screen” button to fix the figure’s label spacing) From fiscal 2015 to 2017, we observe a growth in gross profit by approximately 4%, moving from $2.918 billion in 2015 to a peak of $3.040 billion in fiscal 2017. Between the fiscal years 2016 and 2017, there is a decrease in other costs (costs other than asset impairments), dropping from 98.88% to 87.15%. However, during this same period, there is a significant increase in goodwill and asset impairments, which rose from 1.12% to 12.85%. This trend intensified by the end of fiscal 2018, with goodwill and asset impairments escalating to $1.015 billion or 44.01% of the gross profit. This surge in impairments could be a driving factor behind GameStop’s strategic decision to reduce other costs to 55.99% in 2018, down from 87.15% the previous fiscal year, aiming to optimize profitability due to rising impairment costs. In their financial statement for the fiscal year 2017, GameStop revealed a devaluation in their dealer agreements with both Spring Mobile and Simply Mac. In short, a dealer agreement is a contractual arrangement, allowing GameStop to sell products from these manufacturers. Breaking down the asset impairment charges, $328.8 million was linked to Spring Mobile agreements, while $11 million was associated with Simply Mac agreements. This devaluation stemmed from revised profitability projections, which were less optimistic than earlier estimates. This miscalculation in asset profitability likely contributed to the notable dip in net income for fiscal 2017, and thus influenced GameStop’s decision to implement cost-cutting measures in fiscal 2018. To support our hypothesis, we turn our attention to GameStop’s operating margin. This indicator provides a deeper understanding of a firm’s earnings from its core business operations, encompassing areas like production, marketing, and other related functions. By comparing operating margin to net profit margin, we can measure the influence of non-core operations on the net income, such as the effects of losses from asset sales. Like the previous evaluation of GameStop’s asset effects on its gross profit and subsequent net income for fiscal years 2017 to 2018, we observe an increase in net profit margin from 0.406% to 8.123% and in the operating margin from 5.140% to 8.470%. This trend aligns with the earlier hypothesis that GameStop undertook cost cutting measures to increase its profitability in fiscal 2018. But, the sharp rise in net profit margin by 7.717% relative to the 3.33% increase in operating margin suggests that the cut expenses were predominantly non-operational rather than core operational costs. Assuming that the dealer agreements were the primary reason behind the significant dip in GameStop’s net income in fiscal 2017, the subsequent spike in net profit margin for fiscal 2018 can likely be attributed to GameStop’s move to sell its entire equity in Spring mobile on January 16, 2019. From this transaction, GameStop gained a total of $729.9 million or, after tax, $65.4 million. Analysis Overview In our analysis so far, we’ve delved into GameStop’s financial reports, focusing on their profitability and operational efficiency during the fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Notably, in response to a marked decline in net income in fiscal 2017, largely attributed to the dealer agreement losses, GameStop enhanced its profitability in fiscal 2018 by cutting non-core expenses, mitigating the effects of increasing losses from asset impairments. While this provides valuable insights, a more comprehensive perspective can be gained by benchmarking GameStop’s financial metrics against its competitors in the retail sector. The next chapter undertakes this comparative analysis to offer a more nuanced view of GameStop’s financial health. "],["gamestops-performance-relative-to-competitors.html", "GameStop’s Performance Relative to Competitors Comparing Profitability Metrics Analysis Overview", " GameStop’s Performance Relative to Competitors Comparing Profitability Metrics In our comparison analysis, we begin by evaluating each company’s gross profits and associated margins. GameStop consistently experienced the lowest gross profit across all fiscal years, notably reaching its minimum at $1.2595 billion in fiscal 2019. Looking back to fiscal 2016, we can observe a declining trend in GameStop’s gross profits, from $3.0093 billion to $1.3721 billion in fiscal 2022. In contrast, both Best Buy and Walmart had upward trajectories in their gross profits over the same period. Walmart’s gross profit increased from $121 billion in fiscal 2016 to $143 billion in fiscal 2022, while Best Buy saw a surge from $9.194 billion to $11.64 billion. Moreover, GameStop’s diminishing gross profit is mirrored in its gross profit margin, which declined from 34.96% in fiscal 2016 to 23.15% in fiscal 2022. Comparatively, Best Buy and Walmart maintained stable gross profit margins with minor changes. Best Buy’s margin hovered around 23.26% in fiscal 2016 and changed slightly to 22.49% in fiscal 2022, while Walmart’s margin remained consistent, shifting from 25.13% in fiscal 2016 to 25.10% in fiscal 2022. Considering the downtrend in gross profit and margin for GameStop compared to Best Buy and Walmart since fiscal 2016, it implies a growing operational costs for GameStop. Interestingly, the narrowing gap in profit margins between fiscal 2020 and 2022 could indicate that GameStop is shifting its focus to e-commerce, thereby aligning its operations more closely with those of its competitors. When comparing net incomes across all fiscal years, Walmart consistently outperforms both GameStop and Best Buy, with its lowest net income recorded in fiscal 2019 at $7.179 billion. Also, Best Buy consistently reports higher net incomes than GameStop over the years, with its lowest in fsical 2013 at $411 million. Interestingly, fiscal 2013 saw the smallest net income gap between GameStop and Best Buy, with a difference of only $57 million, where GameStop reported $354.2 million. In every fiscal year, GameStop’s net income trails both Walmart and Best Buy. Yet, when we delve into net profit margins, GameStop stands out. It consistently has higher net profit margins than its competitors in every fiscal year except for fiscal 2017, where it had a margin of only 0.406%. A notable instance was in 2018 when GameStop led with a net profit margin of 8.123%, significantly ahead of Best Buy’s 2.370% and Walmart’s 2.100%. Even though GameStop lags in absolute net income, the company had an average net profit margin of 4.75%, frequently surpassing its competitors. Analysis Overview From this comparative analysis, it is evident that GameStop, in terms of size and overall profit, is dwarfed especially by Walmart. However, when accessing profitability in terms of margins, GameStop often matches or even outperforms its competitors. Despite GameStop’s smaller profit figures, the proportion of profit it retains from its revenues is notable and suggests further investigation. "],["conclusions-and-recommendations.html", "Conclusions and Recommendations", " Conclusions and Recommendations In wrapping up this analysis, let us circle back to the core questions mentioned in the introduction. How does GameStop’s profitability reflected in its financials? Through an in depth review of GameStop’s gross and net profit margins, as well as its operating margins and other expenses, we have been able to gain insights into its financial health. A notable observation was GameStop’s adaptation following the asset impairments between fiscal 2017 and 2018, which seems to have led to improved profitability in subsequent years. However, it is crucial to note that the interpretation of “profitability” remains subjective and ultimately falls upon the investor’s perspective. How does GameStop adapt to particular financial shifts? The period between fiscal 2017 and 2018, marked by increasing goodwill and asset impairments, showcased GameStop’s strategic move to reduce non-operational expenses. This allowed the company to counteract the effects of asset impairment losses and subsequently enhance its profitability from fiscal 2019 onwards. For a more holistic understanding, I recommend a detailed exploration into GameStop’s reasoning for acquiring these assets and financial strategies and performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. When benchmarked financially, how does GameStop compare to its key competitors? In a side by side comparison with giants like Best Buy and Walmart, GameStop emerges as the smaller entity in terms of net income and gross profits. However, a noteworthy mention is that GameStop’s net and gross profit margins stand relatively tall, often equaling or surpassing these industry leaders. To gain a more nuanced perspective, I recommend comparing GameStop with other competitors closer in size. Such a comparison might offer clearer insights into GameStop’s financial standing within its competitive landscape.
