In contrast, the highest revenue was observed in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2021, totaling to $2,253.9 billion. Between 2020 and 2021, each quarter experienced a significant revenue increase compared to other years, with growth rates of 25.05%, 25.63%, 29.05%, and 6.21% for Q1 through Q4, respectively. In comparison, from 2021 to 2022, the revenue changes for each quarter were more modest: 8% in Q1, 4% in Q2, 9% in Q3, and 1% in Q4. Revenue serves as a vital measure of a company’s overall well-bring, influencing both investment decisions and the company’s operational strategies. Judging solely by its revenue performance, GME had an excellent financial run in 2020 and 2021. The year 2021 was particularly strong, with revenue growth exceeding 25% in three out of its four quarters compared to the same quarters in the prior year. In all quarters except Q4, GME reported a net loss with the most significant loss occurring in Q1 of fiscal 2020 at $165.7 million. When we look at the net income ratios between the quarters from 2020 to 2021, we see varying numbers: 0.4031 for Q1, 0.5535 for Q2, 5.6064 for Q3, and -1.8323 for Q4. A negative ratio points to a flip in the sign of net income. The highest profit was recording in Q4 of 2020, totaling $80.5 million. Net income is another crucial financial indicator that sheds light on a company’s profitability. A positive net income usually indicates good financial health, making the firm more appealing to potential investors and paving the way for growth. Generally, GME has seen net losses quarter over quarter. Its expenses have mostly been larger than its revenue. Does that mean GME has been financially struggling since 2020? Not necessarily. The company might still have positive cash flow, vital for daily operations and future planning. But, the recurring net losses do raise questions about its financial stability, suggesting a deeper investigation into its cash flows over the years. A short analysis of GameStop shows noticeable differences in both revenue and net income. The fluctuations in these financial indicators, particularly in the fiscal year 2021, suggests a more in depth review of the company’s financial situation. "],["a-closer-examination.html", "A Closer Examination", " A Closer Examination By the end of the fiscal year 2021, GameStop underwent numerous changes. One of the most notable being a change in leadership. Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, took over as GameStop’s new CEO and chairman of the board. He quickly implemented a change in business direction, aiming to expand their online sales and reorganize GameStop as an e-commerce company specializing in gaming and entertainment. Under new leadership, GameStop managed to reduce its total debt by approximately $314.6 million and raise around $1672.8 million in equity capital by the end of fiscal year 2021. This means that, at one point during that year, GameStop had accumulated enough assets to fully cover its obligations should the company be liquidated and had some surplus. But, by the end of the following fiscal year, 2022, the company’s equity had dropped significantly by about 17.42%, while its liabilities had only decreased by 5.57%. This indicates that unless there is a turnaround, GameStop could find itself back in the precarious financial position it was in before 2021. Simply put, the debt to equity ratio (D/E) shows how much debt a company has for each dollar of equity. A high D/E ratio usually suggests a riskier investment, while a low ratio suggests the opposite. In fiscal year 2021, GameStop saw a 74.60% drop in its D/E ratio. By the close of that year, the company had about $1.18 in debt for every dollar of equity, a significant improvement compared to the $4.66 in debt for each dollar of equity it had in 2020. This change indicates that GameStop became a less risky investment option. Many of these metrics are great and all for showing how GME performed during the peculiar period of fiscal 2021. But, by comparing its performance in these areas against its competitors will really show how it performed in the market and thus its overall financial health.
