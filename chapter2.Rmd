# A Closer Examination Into Financial Statements{-}
By the end of the fiscal year 2021, GameStop underwent numerous changes. One of the most notable being a change in leadership. Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, took over as GameStop's new CEO and chairman of the board. He quickly implemented a change in business direction, aiming to expand their online sales and reorganize GameStop as an e-commerce company specializing in gaming and entertainment.

Under new management, GameStop managed to cut its long-term debt by $604 million, **a decrease of 73.68%**, by the end of the fiscal 2021 year. Additionally, they raised shareholder equity by about $266.3 billion, an increase of 19.93%. This put the company on a path where, if it were to be liquidated, its assets might cover all its debts, possibly leaving some surplus. But by the end of the 2022 fiscal year, there was a decline in the company's equity by nearly 17.42%, whereas its liabilities only fell by 5.57%. If this trend continues, GameStop could find itself in a more financially unstable situation than it faced before 2021.

Simply put, the **debt to equity ratio** (D/E) shows how much debt a company has for each dollar of equity. A high D/E ratio usually suggests a riskier investment, while a low ratio suggests the opposite. In fiscal year 2021, GameStop saw a **74.60%** drop in its D/E ratio. By the close of that year, the company had about $1.18 in debt for every dollar of equity, a significant improvement compared to the $4.66 in debt for each dollar of equity it had in 2020. This change indicates that GameStop became a less risky investment option. 


Many of these metrics are great and all for showing how GME performed during the peculiar period of fiscal 2021. But, by comparing its performance in these areas against its competitors will really show how it performed in the market and thus its overall financial health.
